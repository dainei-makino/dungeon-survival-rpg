# Environment Character Assets

This directory stores JSON vertex data for decorative environment characters.
The files are loaded directly by the game.

Each mesh file uses the same JSON format as other characters. Besides
`voxelHeight`, environment models may include an optional `baseOffset`
indicating how far the origin is above the ground. This offset is applied
when positioning the item in the world so the model rests on the ground.
